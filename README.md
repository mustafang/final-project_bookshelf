# Bookshelf
Bookshelf is a website designed to help users manage their book collections digitally. With Bookshelf, users can easily add, edit, delete, and search for books in their collection. This project is part of my final project "Learn to Create a Front-End Web for Beginners" at Dicoding Indonesia.
## Features
1. **Add Books**: Users can add new books to their collection with information such as title, author, genre, and publication year.
2. **Edit Books**: Users can update the information of existing books.
3. **Delete Books**: Users can remove books from their collection.
4. **Search Books**: Users can search for books in their collection by title, author, or genre.
5. **Book Status**: Users can mark books as 'read' or 'unread' and separate the list of books based on this status.
## The files used in this project include:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the basic structure of the website.
- **style.css**: The CSS file for styling and layout of the website.
- **main.js**: The JavaScript file for handling the logic and interactivity of the website.
- **ava.jpg and nav.jpg**: Image files used on the web page.
